# One-Friend-Application
Mobile Application on Mindfulness - 

Many changes are experienced during studies at school or college and it can be overwhelming and stressful for example Homesickness, final exam stress, dealing with common illness and depression etc. It is critical that students deal with these issues, recognize their emotional imbalances and not allow them to interfere with their ability to perform all the academic functions in their day-to-day life. 

In light of this requirement, we would like to propose a mobile application (One friend) that will be designed to provide its users the means to track, score and notice the changes in their day-to-day stress levels, to improve their well-being with the use of relevant mindfulness tools and provide necessary reports. One friend empowers students to easily prepare, manage and bring changes to their lifestyle, check their well-being, improving their education performance and routinely suggesting new ways to practice the art of mindfulness.
